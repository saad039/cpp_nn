This is intented to be an implementation of vanilla neural network in C++20
with random weights and biases initialization, forward and back propagation at compile time. 

My goal is to train a neural network to predict the output of a XOR logic gate 
in under 13 lines of assembly code by taking advantage of C++'s constexpr engine.

Work under progress. 


To build the project, simply

> ```make config=release```
